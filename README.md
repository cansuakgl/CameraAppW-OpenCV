### projeCamera

A desktop camera app lets users take photos, apply filters, and save their pictures on their devices. It uses OpenCV for image processing and filters, while Swing and AWT handle the user interface. This setup keeps the app simple, easy to use, and efficient for photo capturing and editing.
